# pico-profile

This project goal is to emulate a Profile/Widget hard disk.
My ultimate goal is to be able to use this circuit with my Apple Lisa computer.

It's a work in progress and not yet ready for production.

## Demo
A short video showing the project in action is available on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/dQjzqoluw7A)

## Licensing
The final license of this project is not yet determined.
No commercial usage of this project can be made.

## TODO:
- Improve how Apple resets the MCU
- Add buttons to choose the disk image to use
- ~~Add more silkscreen information (power supply polarity...)~~
- Design a 3D printed enclosure
- ~~Fix the 74L280 footprint on PCB~~
- Make a through hole PCB version
- Test it with an Apple III
